retrofitting a raspberry pi into a pioneer KE-81ZBM

I'm attempting to build about 6 daughter boards which will retrofit a new control interface for a Raspberry Pi
into the chassis and faceplate of the old device. I'd like it to be able to play MP3s off internal storage as well as serve as a Bluetooth A2DP sink. I hope to replace the old segement LCD with a new one that will display song titles, playlist names, etc. (including from bluetooth sources). I'd also like all of the buttons and lights on the old faceplate to be controllable by the Raspberry Pi. I'm replacing the volume potentiometer with a digital rotary encoder. And the tape drive is removed. Not quite sure what, if anything, will be behind the door.
