retrofitting a raspberry pi into a pioneer KE-81ZBM

![faceplate of KE-81ZBM](https://github.com/tewhalen/pi_car_stereo/blob/master/doc/images/radio6_KE-83ZBM.jpg)

I'm attempting to build about 6 daughter boards which will retrofit a new control interface for a Raspberry Pi
into the chassis and faceplate of the old device.
